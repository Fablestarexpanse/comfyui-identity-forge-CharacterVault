"""IdentityForgeCosplayer node — fictional characters as a worn cosplay look.

Pick (or randomize) a fictional character and emit a JSON document of overrides.
Wire its ``character_json`` output into the ``archetype_json`` input of an
:class:`~nodes.identity_forge.IdentityForge` node (it shares that socket with the
Archetype node — use one or the other). The character's costume defines the
*look* and IdentityForge randomizes the person underneath, so every run is a
different individual cosplaying the same character.

Two look levels:

* **Costume only** (default) — only the costume and a few signature look traits
  (hair, eyes) are sent, so body, face, and demographics stay free to randomize.
  This is the "a random person cosplaying X" mode.
* **Full character** — also locks the character's physique (body type, height,
  skin tone, …) for a faithful reproduction; the scene still randomizes.

The *person's* gender is chosen on the IdentityForge node, independent of the
character's, so crossplay (e.g. a man cosplaying a female character) works: the
downstream gender gate drops any value invalid for the chosen gender. The source
character's gender here only scopes the "Random — female / male" picks.

The engine half (:func:`build_cosplayer_json`) is a pure function, testable
without ComfyUI.
